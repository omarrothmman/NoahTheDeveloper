Exploit an ubuntu machine of a careless, noob wordpress developer and try to take root privilege .
# Installation tips 
Here are the [machine files](https://terabox.com/s/1Z87_lE1Yy1Zj6lEnCRiliA)  

Configure the virtual machine network adapter to either host-only or bridged   

If host only: make sure your attacking machine is also configured host only in the same network as the machine.  

If bridged: scan your network to know the IP address of the machine and look for an ubuntu machine running FTP at port 2121    

# IMPORTANT
Apache server is running on the machine and it is slow by purpose keep that in mind.  
There are 3 flags: user1.txt, user2.txt, root.txt
