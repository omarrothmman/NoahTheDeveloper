# NoahTheDeveloper
exploit an ubuntu machine of a careless, noob wordpress developer and try to take root privilege .
# installation guide 
Here is the [machine files](https://terabox.com/s/12YNlO8mw3lZIFxpeCY2NGg)
configure the virtual machine to use either host-only or bridged 
if host only: make sure your attacking machine is also configured host only in the same network as the machine.
if bridged: scan your network to know the IP address of the machine and look for an ubuntu machine running FTP at port 2121  
# IMPORTANT
apache server is running on the machine and it is slow by purpose keep that in mind
